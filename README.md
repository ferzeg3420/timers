# timers
A bunch of timers to help my mama cook

Built using React JS.

I've included the build and all the package.json files, so you/I should be able to run this project by going to the base directory (AKA folder) and doing 
`npm start`
(CAVEAT: you need to have Google Chrome installed on your machine)

If you/I make changes, `npm run dev` builds the code in development mode. `npm run prod` for production (minifies the code and some other stuff I am sure).

I used webpack for the build process. If you need help (possibly a reminder for future me), here are a couple good primers I found:
https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack/
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/part-1-react-app-from-scratch-using-webpack-4-562b1d231e75/

The freecodecamp one is slightly outdated because webpack is on the major version 5 as of the writing of this.

## Source
Contains the source code for this webapp.

## Build
The "compiled" (transpiled to vanilla js) build.
